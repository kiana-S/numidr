# NumIdr Guide

Welcome to NumIdr's guide! This guide will serve as a basic introduction to the core ideas of NumIdr, as well as a reference for common functions and utilities that you might otherwise miss.

If you're familiar with the Python library [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) or anything based on it, then a lot of the early content will be familiar, as NumIdr is based on the same array type.

> [!NOTE]
> This guide assumes a basic understanding of linear algebra, and it will not explain any linear algebra concepts necessary for understanding NumIdr's structure.
