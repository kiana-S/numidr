# NumIdr

NumIdr is a linear algebra and data manipulation library for Idris 2. It features
an efficient, type-safe array data structure, as well as utilities for working with
vector spaces and matrices. It borrows concepts heavily from Python's [NumPy](https://numpy.org/),
as well as Rust's [nalgebra](https://www.nalgebra.org/).

The name is pronounced like "num-idge".
